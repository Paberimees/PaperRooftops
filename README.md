## PowBot Mobile 
Tested using Powbot mobile with LDPlayer - ran fairly smooth. Viewport should be fairly zoomed out and in a top-down view for it to work best. In the picture above you can see the fruit of botting agility, below you can see how many laps you can expect before getting graceful.

### Screenshots (mobile):

## PowBot Desktop
Currently testing with desktop; Seems like it needs help with clicks, but unsure how to get it consistent there. Screenshots for desktop probably coming on future accounts.
