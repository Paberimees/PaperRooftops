PaperRooftops - made for mobile; but usable on desktop - probably.

Tested using Powbot mobile with LDPlayer - ran fairly smooth. Has some error correction built in to it.

Currently testing with desktop; Seems like it does require some custom bounds aswell, as it had trouble with clicking varrock rooftop Gap earlier.
