# PaperRooftops

## PowBot Mobile 
Tested using Powbot mobile with LDPlayer - ran fairly smooth. Viewport should be fairly zoomed out and in a top-down view for it to work best, it seemed. Currently only Falador is updated to use bounds from custom debug tool, but other courses probably still work, as shown in the pictures below.

### Screenshots (mobile):

## PowBot Desktop
Currently testing with desktop; Seems like it does require some custom bounds aswell, as it had trouble with clicking varrock rooftop Gap earlier, got hardstuck.
Screenshots for desktop not available due to temp-ban.
